# Virtual Mouse

## Description
Move the mouse's pointer and trigger some events such as left and right clicks, double click, vertical and horizontal scrolling, copy, cut, paste, quit, ...etc based on hand gesture's detection by using an AI model.

Each event is associated to one gesture defined by number of fingers up.

You find the default configuration in `configfile.ini`, as you can modify it
